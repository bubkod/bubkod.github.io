      <h3 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS, Comic Sans, cursive;"> •Don't Grief ( Will result in a permanent ban )</h3>
      
      <h3 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS, Comic Sans, cursive;"> •No cheating, Autoclicker allowed because I don't believe that counts as a cheat (Having a client on your PC would not result a ban, However using it would do)</h3>
    
      <h3 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS, Comic Sans, cursive;"> •We are living in A society, so don't be a dumbass and live by yourself</h3> 
      
       <h3 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS, Comic Sans, cursive;"> •No Speedrunning</h3>
      
      <h3 style="font-family: Comic Sans MS, Comic Sans, cursive;"> •Owner abuses are allowed and the reason it could possibly happen is having a bad reputation or begging for items and /give commands, Try not to act like a monkey.</h3>
